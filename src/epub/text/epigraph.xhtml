				<p>“And there was one herd of many swine feeding on this mountain; and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.</p>
				<p>“Then went the devils out of the man and entered into the swine; and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake and were choked.</p>
				<p>“When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country.</p>
				<p>“Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.”</p>
